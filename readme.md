**Running Code**
- Run main.py to produce graphs
    - main.py imports several other necessary py files, but there's no need to run those (but sometimes, you need to run those individual files to get the imports to work)
- Run tests.py to run tests
    - tests.py imports other neccessary files, as well as a small dataset, which is all included
- Run machine_learning.py to print accuracy scores

**Libraries**
- May need to install the tabula library, as well as geopandas

**Dataset**
- Datasets are in the google folder linked here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1enQuEzLE1UGGFCb0YsyrApRrDVjoXJjP?usp=sharing
- Included in the folder are pdfs of pages in the metatdata documentation, which are necessary for the pdf scraping to work (we included the pdfs in the directory that we submitted as well)
